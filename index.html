                    <h2>Where it all started</h2>
                    <p>While working in different organizations,  
                        I noticed the same patterns that keep teams from being productive.  
                        While people were busy, releases were slow and error-prone and customers
                        unhappy.  The features that were rolled didn't solve the
                        customer needs, resulting in bloated processes that inhibited rather than
                        improved the customer journey. 
                    </p>
        
                    <p>
                        Everyone was frustrated by the amount of rework to
                        get while organizational debt kept increasing.
                                     
                        Team members were demotivated, never given adequate time to 
                        deal with organizational debt and improve, restricted by a lack 
                        of ownerships and silo's competing with each other internally.  
                        There was clearly no winner.                   
                        The outcome was a lot of wasted effort.
                                   
                        I realized that productivity is not so much about speed or efficiency, 
                        but about accuracy and relationships.
                    </p>

                                         to get the maximum usable outputs. It's not done until someone
                                         uses and loves it. </p>
